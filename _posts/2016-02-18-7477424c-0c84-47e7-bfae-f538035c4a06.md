About me

I practiced yoga on and off throughout my youth and started practical consistently when I moved to Kelowna for University. Having always had a passion for health and fitness I grew up competing in springboard diving and speed swimming and transitioned to coaching after retiring due to injury.  Yoga helped me discover the fight I was slowly losing to depression and provided me with a foundation to rebuild my life. It has done so much for me I cannot imagine passing on this experience to others. I completed my 200hr yoga teacher training in Nicaragua with the awe-inspiring Meghan Currie and hope practicing together we can challenge our minds and our bodies to work to expand our comfort zone while having fun doing it.
